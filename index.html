        <h2>About Dara</h2>
        <p>
          "Dara" is an ancient strategy game that originated in West Africa long
          before the proliferation of modern board games. This game, often
          referred to as "Dara" or "Draughts," stands as one of the most notable
          examples of how games can transcend borders and cultures, carrying
          with them a rich historical heritage and intellectual challenges. The
          history of "Dara" dates back centuries, and its strategic complexity
          continues to captivate players of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dara" is a traditional African game with deep roots in the Sahel
          region, encompassing territories that now include Senegal, Mali,
          Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. It is believed that the game was
          originally created by the Soninke, a people of West Africa, and its
          history can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the
          Empire of Ghana, one of the earliest African empires. The game was so
          highly esteemed that in some cultures, kings and tribal chiefs kept
          advisors trained in "Dara" to develop strategic thinking skills.
          Furthermore, "Dara" played a significant role in preserving the
          history and culture of the region, as game pieces were often
          intricately carved with depictions of animals, tribal symbols, and
          elements of nature.

      <h2>About us and the web page</h2>
      <p style="display: block;">
        The main purpose of designing the website was to apply the methods and knowledge acquired during theoretical classes. Throughout the project, we used languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During the entire process, Professor José Leal was very helpful and always available to assist. The goal was to create a single-page application that would provide an online version of the Dara game (explained earlier). The project is divided into three delivery phases, and it is currently in the first phase.
