        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dara is a two-player strategy game</strong> played on a 6x5
            board.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each player chooses a type of piece (coin, stone, or leaf) and
            receives 12 pieces to place on the board.
          </li>
          <li>The game consists of two phases:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Placement Phase:</strong> Players take turns placing their
              pieces, one at a time, in empty spaces on the board. It is not
              allowed to place more than three pieces of the same type in a row.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Movement Phase:</strong> Players take turns moving their
              pieces, one at a time. Pieces can be moved to adjacent spaces,
              horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The objective of the game is to form lines of three or more pieces
            of the same type. When this happens, the player can capture an
            opponent's piece.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game ends when a player can no longer make a valid move. The
            player who can no longer play loses the game.
          </li>

              "Dara" is an ancient strategy game that originated in West Africa
              long before the proliferation of modern board games. This game,
              often referred to as "Dara" or "Draughts," stands as one of the
              most notable examples of how games can transcend borders and
              cultures, carrying with them a rich historical heritage and
              intellectual challenges. The history of "Dara" dates back
              centuries, and its strategic complexity continues to captivate
              players of all ages.
