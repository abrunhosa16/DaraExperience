          <h2>About Dara</h2>
          <p>
            "Dara" is an ancient strategy game that originated in West Africa
            long before the proliferation of modern board games. This game,
            often referred to as "Dara" or "Draughts," stands as one of the most
            notable examples of how games can transcend borders and cultures,
            carrying with them a rich historical heritage and intellectual
            challenges. The history of "Dara" dates back centuries, and its
            strategic complexity continues to captivate players of all ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Dara" is a traditional African game with deep roots in the Sahel
            region, encompassing territories that now include Senegal, Mali,
            Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. It is believed that the game
            was originally created by the Soninke, a people of West Africa, and
            its history can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the
            Empire of Ghana, one of the earliest African empires. The game was
            so highly esteemed that in some cultures, kings and tribal chiefs
            kept advisors trained in "Dara" to develop strategic thinking
            skills. Furthermore, "Dara" played a significant role in preserving
            the history and culture of the region, as game pieces were often
            intricately carved with depictions of animals, tribal symbols, and
            elements of nature.
